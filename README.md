# ðŸ§± My First Blockchain (Python Learning Project)

This is a toy blockchain Iâ€™m building to understand how cryptocurrencies work under the hood.  
It includes basic functionality like:

- A blockchain with proof of work
- Elliptic curve cryptography for signing transactions
- Multiple user key support
- Tampering detection

## How to Run

```bash
python test_run.py  # Simulates block mining and basic transaction flow
