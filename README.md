#My Blockchain Learning Journey üöÄ
Over the past few weeks, I've been building my own blockchain project from scratch using Python. This journey has been one of the most exciting and challenging experiences in my learning process so far. I've not only deepened my understanding of how cryptocurrencies and decentralized systems work, but also significantly improved my programming and problem-solving skills.

#üîç What I've Learned
Blockchain Basics: I learned how a blockchain is structured, how blocks are linked using hashes, and how immutability is achieved through cryptographic integrity.

Proof of Work: I implemented a basic proof-of-work algorithm, which helped me understand how mining works and why it's computationally expensive.

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC): Diving into ECC was a turning point. I built point addition and scalar multiplication from scratch, which gave me insight into how private and public keys are generated.

Digital Signatures: I learned how digital signatures ensure authenticity and prevent tampering, and I implemented a signature verification system for transactions.

Multi-user Transactions: I added support for multiple users and their key pairs, allowing for more realistic transaction simulations.

#ü§ñ How ChatGPT Helped
This entire journey was guided by my interactions with ChatGPT. Here's how it helped:

Breaking Down Complex Topics: ECC and cryptographic signatures were intimidating at first. ChatGPT explained them step-by-step and helped me build my own implementations with comments in the code.

Debugging and Design: Whenever I got stuck or had bugs, I asked ChatGPT for guidance. It suggested clean, Pythonic solutions and helped me think through edge cases.

Structuring My Learning: I followed a custom learning roadmap created with ChatGPT, which included projects, resources, and weekly goals tailored to my interests in blockchain and computer science.

#üìà Personal Growth
Looking back, I realize how much I've grown as a developer:

I'm now more comfortable reading and writing cryptographic code.

I understand how to design systems that simulate real-world decentralized applications.

Most importantly, I've learned how to learn‚Äîhow to break down big challenges and approach them step-by-step.

This project is only the beginning. I‚Äôm planning to continue with networking, custom transaction formats, and even building a basic peer-to-peer layer next. I‚Äôll keep updating this repository as I make progress.

Thanks for reading! üåü
