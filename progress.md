# Blockchain Learning Journal

This project is part of my personal journey to learn how blockchains work from scratch.

## What Iâ€™ve Learned So Far

- How a blockchain links blocks together using hashes
- How Proof of Work makes mining difficult
- How to create and verify digital signatures using elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)
- How to support multiple users and secure transactions with their key pairs
- How to detect tampering in transactions

## How ChatGPT Helped

- Explained ECC and digital signatures in a simple way
- Helped me debug point addition and signature verification
- Suggested improvements and helped me think like a developer

## What's Next?

- Custom transaction formats
- Peer-to-peer networking basics
- Conflict resolution between nodes

Iâ€™ll keep updating this as I go ðŸš€
